# Setup troubleshooting FAQ

- **`lint` exits 127.** `python3` isn't on `PATH`. Install it or point `PYTHON` at an interpreter.
- **A local skill folder mounts empty.** Untracked files are invisible to the mount — `git add` the skill
  first (see [README → Test a local skill in one command](../README.md#test-a-local-skill-in-one-command)).
- **`docker build` fails or the agent won't start on Apple Silicon.** Confirm `--platform linux/arm64` is in
  your `docker build` invocation and that Docker Desktop's VM is arm64, not Rosetta-emulated.
- **A git worktree can't find your token.** A worktree's `./.env` is gitignored and absent there even if the
  main checkout has one. Point at it: `cowork-harness --dotenv <path-to-main-checkout>/.env <cmd>`, or run
  `doctor` — it detects this and prints the exact remedy.
- **A live run hangs with no egress activity.** Check the egress-proxy container actually started
  (`docker ps` for `cowork-egress-proxy`); a race on first run can leave it building while the agent already
  attempted a request. Re-run once the image is built (`doctor --tier container` reports proxy-image status).
- **Reading `doctor`'s output.** Each line is one check: `✓` ok, `✗` fail (blocks the tier), `!` warn
  (works but worth fixing), `·` skipped (not needed for this tier). A `✗`/`!` line prints a `→ remedy`
  right after it — that's the fix, not a generic "something's wrong." Common `✗`s: Node < 20, no
  Docker/container runtime running, the agent image not built, the staged agent binary missing (open
  Cowork Desktop once to stage it), no auth token resolvable, or no platform baseline on disk (`sync`
  on macOS, or restore a `baselines/desktop-*.json`).
- **A `verify-cassettes` run fails on `scenarioDrift` after an intentional scenario edit.** You edited a
  committed scenario's `prompt`, `baseline`, `fidelity`, `answers`, `skills`, or `requires_capabilities`
  without re-recording — the frozen cassette no longer matches the on-disk scenario on one of these six
  recording-shaping fields. Either re-record, or pass `--skip-scenario-drift` if you're intentionally
  verifying the rest of the gate against an out-of-date recording (see [README → Commands at a glance](../README.md#commands-at-a-glance)).

- **A skill works in the Claude Code CLI but misbehaves under Cowork's host-loop.** Two common footguns:
  a `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path hardcoded into in-VM bash (dead in the host-loop VM — resolve the mount
  at runtime instead), and a hook command that `export`s an env var or writes into `/tmp` (a host-side
  hook write isn't VM-visible to the agent). `scenario.py lint-skill <SKILL.md | skill-dir>` scans a
  skill's body (and any sibling `hooks.json`) for both, WARN-only and deliberately narrow (fenced bash/sh/
  shell code blocks, hooks-config JSON, and `Bash(...)` directives only — host-side prose and `Read`/`Grep`
  directives are left alone, so false negatives on unfenced snippets are expected).
