# Session reference

A **session** (a "session setup", `sessions/*.yaml`) captures everything you configure in Claude Cowork **before the first prompt** of a new session. It's hand-authored, lives in your repo, and is reused across scenarios. It is deliberately separate from the [platform baseline](./maintenance.md) (`baselines/desktop-*.json`), which is auto-synced and describes what Cowork's runtime *is* this release.

> One-line mental model: **platform baseline = the release; session = your setup.**

**Minimal session** — the smallest setup that mounts one skill and pins a model; every field is optional
(a scenario with no `session:` gets an all-defaults inline session):

```yaml
model: claude-opus-4-8
skills:
  local: ["./skills/my-skill"]
```

The full schema below documents every field.

                                 # "Staleness hash_ignore globs" below.
```

### Staleness `hash_ignore` globs

`hash_ignore` globs are matched against each mounted skill/plugin dir's **root-relative** path:

| Form | Matches |
|---|---|
| `tests` / `tests/` | a `tests` entry at ANY depth (bare name; trailing slash optional) |
| `/tests` | anchored to the mount root only (leading slash = root-relative) |
| `docs/api` | a root-anchored path with a slash component |
| `**/tests` | explicit any-depth (same as bare `tests`) |
| `**/*.md` | any `.md` at any depth |

The cassette-staleness hash skips ignored paths, so editing them no longer re-stales cassettes. The
harness also **hard-excludes** universally-non-runtime paths: VCS/caches/cassettes, the `plugin.json`
`version` field, and (v5+) OS-junk (`.DS_Store` / `Thumbs.db` / `desktop.ini`) — so a Finder touch can't
re-stale a cassette. A plugin's own runtime boundary (and any run-generated files a skill writes into its
own dir) are yours to declare here or in a plugin-local `.cowork-hashignore` file at the mount root. For
per-skill scoping in a multi-skill plugin, set `skills: [<name>]` on the **scenario** (see scenario.md /
cassette.md); opt-in `COWORK_HARNESS_AGENT_SCOPE=skill` further scopes a skill-named `agents/<name>.md` to
that skill instead of the shared root.

## Field reference

### Model & reasoning
| Field | Type | Cowork control | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | model picker | e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`. Omit to use the agent default. |
| `effort` | enum | effort selector | `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `xhigh`. Passed as the `--effort` CLI flag (the `CLAUDE_EFFORT` env var is a no-op). |
| `max_thinking_tokens` | number \| map | thinking budget | a flat **positive integer**, or a per-model map `{ default, <model>: <n> }` of them (0/negative are rejected), resolved per-model (Cowork's `f7e`) and emitted as `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`. Default `31999` (binary-verified `DEFAULT_MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`). The `extended_thinking` bool is inert — not a real Cowork toggle; use this field. |
| `permission_mode` | enum | permission mode | `default` \| `acceptEdits` \| `plan` \| `bypassPermissions` → `--permission-mode`. |
| `permission_parity` | enum | (harness policy) | `cowork` (default) \| `strict`. `cowork` mirrors Cowork's permission default — unscripted tool calls are allowed; `strict` denies any tool call that no scripted answer / decider covers. Affects the harness `Decider`, not a Cowork control. |

### Folders, projects, uploads
| Field | Maps to | Mounted at |
|---|---|---|
| `folders[]` | "add folder" / Spaces | `mnt/<folder-name>` (collision-resolved basename; ≥1.14271.0, older baselines use `.projects/<id>`) |
| `trusted_folders[]` | `localAgentModeTrustedFolders` | (settings.json; mount without prompt) |
| `auto_mount_folders` | `autoMountFolders` | (settings.json) |
| `uploads[]` | pre-prompt file upload | `mnt/uploads/<basename>` |

For an ad-hoc `skill` run (no session file), the CLI flags **`--upload <file>`** and **`--folder <dir>`**
are the equivalents of `uploads[]` and `folders[]`.

`folders[].mode` is `r` \| `rw` \| `rwd` (read / read-write / read-write-delete), matching Cowork's per-mount grants. (There is no `to:` field — the mount name is always derived from the folder basename, collision-resolved; `.projects` is now only a reserved name.) Enforcement: `r` mounts get a per-mount `:ro` bind on the Docker tiers, so writes fail in the guest; the `rw` vs `rwd` delete-deny distinction is not yet mount-enforced (post-hoc `no_delete_in_outputs` + the planned FUSE delete-deny sub-project — see [boundary.md](./boundary.md)).

### Discovery
See [discovery.md](./discovery.md) for the full model. In short: the harness builds a clean `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` with a generated `settings.json`, mounts plugins at the Cowork paths, and wires `--mcp-config` — every field here is an override knob.

| Field | Maps to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins.marketplaces[]` | `plugin_marketplaces` / `extraKnownMarketplaces` | git URLs or local paths. |
| `plugins.local_marketplaces[]` | `claude plugin marketplace add` | LOCAL marketplace dirs (each holds a `marketplace.json`); plugins they reference are mounted. The `skill --marketplace` flag is the ad-hoc equivalent. |
| `plugins.enabled[]` | `enabledPlugins` | `name@marketplace`. |
| `plugins.local_plugins[]` / `remote_plugins[]` | Cowork plugin mounts | → `mnt/.local-plugins/marketplaces/<marketplace>/<plugin>` (≥1.14271.0; older baselines use `.local-plugins/cache`) / `mnt/.remote-plugins`. |
| `skills.local[]` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills` | extra host **skill** dirs (a folder *without* `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) staged into the config dir's `skills/`. Use this for a single-skill folder; use `plugins.local_plugins` for a plugin root. |
| `mcp.config` / `mcp.enabled[]` | `--mcp-config` / `enabledMcpjsonServers` | the supported way to attach an MCP server to a session under test. |

### Egress
`extra_allow` adds hosts to the release allowlist for this session; `unrestricted: true` reproduces Cowork's `"*"` (allow-all). The allowlist is enforced at `container`/`microvm`/`hostloop` fidelity (and `cowork`, which resolves to one of those) — only `protocol` has no egress boundary; see [boundary.md](./boundary.md).

## Path expansion

`~` expands to your home directory. **Relative paths resolve from the session file's own directory** — so a scenario + its session + the files they reference form a self-contained, relocatable bundle that `run` resolves the same way from any working directory. (A scenario's `session:` likewise resolves relative to the *scenario* file.) Absolute paths and `~` are used as-is. Paths passed as CLI args instead — `skill --upload/--folder` — resolve from your current working directory, since you typed them in your shell.

## Tips

- Keep **one session per realistic setup** (e.g. `sessions/sales.yaml`, `sessions/clinical.yaml`) and point many scenarios at each.
- To reproduce a *specific* real Cowork setup, pin `plugins.config_dir` to a copy of that `~/.claude` instead of letting the harness build a clean one.
- Omit `model` in committed sessions if you want CI to track the agent default; pin it when a test depends on a specific model's behavior.
