Reflect honestly on how the skill's guidance (SKILL.md and anything under references/ or scripts/) served
you while you worked:

1. Was anything in the skill's guidance UNCLEAR, MISSING, or MISLEADING? Be specific — name the file or
   section if you can, and describe exactly what confused you or what you looked for and could not find.
2. Did you have to GUESS at anything (a file path, a format, a parameter value, an ordering) because the
   guidance didn't say? What did you guess, and what would have told you the right answer instead?
3. Did you read something (a reference, a script) and then find it didn't actually help, or find the
   guidance elsewhere contradicted it?
4. Did you dispatch any sub-agents during the task? If you did: was the skill's guidance clear about WHEN
   to dispatch one, WHAT instructions and context to hand it, and what to expect back — or did you have to
   improvise the dispatch prompt, or leave out context the sub-agent turned out to need? Name the specific
   dispatch and exactly what was unclear or under-specified about it. If you dispatched none, say so, and
   note whether the skill left you unsure about whether you should have.
5. List EVERY change to this skill that would have made your job easier this time — do not stop at one.
   Be exhaustive, but keep each entry concrete: name the file or section it belongs in, state the change in
   a sentence or two, and point to the specific moment in THIS run where it would have helped. Order the
   list most impactful first. Leave off anything you cannot tie to something that actually happened in
   this run.

Answer plainly, in prose. Do not restate the task's final answer.`;
