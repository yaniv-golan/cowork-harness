## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

Binary-verified the AskUserQuestion answer wire shape (agent ELF 2.1.170), implemented the
harness-improvements plan, and resolved a 39-finding code-review pass behind two centralizing seams.

### Added

- **AskUserQuestion answer shapes.** `multiSelect` gates (answer with a list of labels → the verified
  comma-joined wire shape); free-text **"Other"** via `answer:` (distinct from the label-validated
  `choose:`); `choose` tolerates the `(Recommended)` suffix + `recommended`/`first` keywords. A partial
  match on a batched gate now **names the unmatched sub-questions**.
- **`artifact_json` assertion** — assert a JSON artifact's contents via a dotted path
  (`equals`/`gt`/`exists`/`absent`/`is_null`); `absent`, `is_null`, and an unresolved intermediate are
  distinct (the last fails loud, never a vacuous pass).
- **Artifact manifest in cassettes** — `record` snapshots `outputs/`/`.projects/` (paths + hashes + small
  JSON bodies) so `file_exists`/`user_visible_artifact`/`artifact_json` run on token-free `replay`. A
  cassette→skill/baseline **staleness fingerprint** warns on drift; `replay --strict` fails on it. Cassettes
  now carry a `cassetteVersion` (forward-compat guard).
- **`RunResult.artifacts`** (ENV-MANIFEST) — observed user-visible files (path + bytes); also surfaced as
  `Result.artifacts` in the Python helper.
- **`allow_permissive_auto_allow` assertion + `RunResult.scan`** — a security-scan surface for the
  Cowork-parity verdict (below); the assertion opts a scenario into a permissive auto-allow on purpose.
- **CLI:** `trace --dispatches` (sub-agent dispatch tree + real total), `assert --list` (schema-generated),
  `scaffold --from-run <id>` (kept run → starter scenario YAML).
- **Python:** `run_scenario()` — run an authored scenario YAML and get the typed `Result`.

### Changed

- **Single verdict source (`computeVerdict()`)** wired into all five pass/fail sites (run/skill exit, footer,
  replay exit, JSON-envelope `ok`) plus the Python `assert_success`. A Cowork-parity violation — a permissive
  auto-allow, a recorded `outputs/` delete, or a host-path leak — now **default-fails** the run unless the
  scenario explicitly asserts about it.
- **Single fail-loud staging policy (`src/staging/resolve.ts`)** for every declared input (marketplace
  manifest, enabled-plugin resolution, local skills, `mcp.config`, uploads, folders), with a Docker-safe
  marketplace charset.
- The run root honors `COWORK_HARNESS_RUNS_DIR`.

### Fixed

- **Egress / runtime hardening:** per-hop redirect egress logging, allowlist validation, a per-run proxy
  port, proxy/sidecar readiness handshakes, fail-loud Lima provisioning, and boundary teardown in
  `try/finally`.
- **Protocol / decider hardening:** oversized control-frame hard-fail, a nonzero child-exit error event,
  provenance untruncation, TTY-elicit cancel, and a JSON-safe `reply_with` key.
- **Detection / packaging:** `%2F`/backslash decode in the outputs-delete detector; the npm package now
  ships `schema/`, `docs/`, `python/`, and `scripts/`; assertion path containment; resume empty-tree warning.

### Notes

- Held/deferred per the plan's gating: composed partial-gate answering, `decider_intent:` in scenario YAML,
  a whole-gate `response:` freeform, and `artifacts_share_field`. All additive/opt-in when built.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-16

Docs, distribution, and packaging. No CLI behavior change.

### Added

- **Companion Claude Code skill, installable.** A `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + skills-directory
  plugin make the bundled skill installable via `/plugin marketplace add yaniv-golan/cowork-harness`;
  the skill self-bootstraps the CLI (`npx cowork-harness@latest`) and fails loud on missing tier deps.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — canonical, cross-tool agent instructions — and **`llms.txt`** doc index.
- **JSON Schema for scenario & session YAML** (`schema/*.schema.json`, generated via `npm run schema`,
  pinned by a token-free drift-guard); `# yaml-language-server: $schema=` hints in the example scenarios.
- README banner, badges, an "For AI agents" section, and `npm install` instructions.

### Changed

- Release pipeline publishes via npm **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** with provenance (no stored token).
- GitHub Actions bumped off the deprecated Node 20 runtime; CI live-scenario job skips cleanly without a key.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-16

Initial public release. A faithful, headless, scriptable harness for Claude Cowork's runtime — for
testing Claude Code **skills** outside the Desktop app with the same staged agent, spawn/control-protocol
contract, egress allowlist, permission protocol, and sandbox limitations. Binary-grounded against
`app.asar` 1.12603.1 / agent ELF 2.1.170.

### Added

- Commands: `skill`, `run`, `chat`, `record`, `replay`, `trace`, and `decide`, plus `sync`,
  `boundary-check`, and `vm` management. Stable `--output-format json` envelope and CI-ready exit codes.
- Five fidelity tiers (`fidelity:`): `protocol`, `container`, `microvm`, `hostloop`, and `cowork`
  (auto-picks host-loop vs container the way Cowork does).
- Scenario YAML — prompt + scripted answers + `assert:` (transcript, files, artifacts, tool / sub-agent
  usage, egress, and more) for authored, asserted regression runs.
- Input policy with no silent false-greens: scripted, LLM, and in-band (`--decider-dir`) answering for
  AskUserQuestion / tool-permission gates; an unanswered gate fails loud.
- Default-deny egress sandbox enforced against the synced Cowork domain allowlist.
- Token-free, Docker-free cassette `record` / `replay` for the PR gate.
- Platform baselines synced from a local Claude Desktop install — nothing Anthropic-owned is bundled
  or distributed.
